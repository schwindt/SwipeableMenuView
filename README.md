# SwipeableMenuView
Swipe to delete for UIStackViews

This works similar like a UITableView swipe to delete behavior.

In the example below, is a UIStackView inside of a UIScrollView. The stackview has a bunch of SwipeableMenuViews. So its possible to scroll vertical and also to swipe the SwipeableMenuViews horizontal.
